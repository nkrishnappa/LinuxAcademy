    Template for creating Objects. All Objects created using the same class will have the same characteristics
    Class creation takes two steps
        __new__
            __new__ is the first step of instance creation. It's called first, and is responsible for returning a new instance of your class.
        __init__
            __init__ doesn't return anything; it's only responsible for initializing the instance after it's been created.
2. Object
    An instance of a class
